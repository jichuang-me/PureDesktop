# PureDesktop User Manual

Welcome to PureDesktop! This manual will help you get the most out of this modern desktop organizer.

## 1. Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download the latest `PureDesktop.zip`.
2. Extract it to any folder (avoid placing it on the desktop itself).
3. Run `PureDesktop.exe`.

### First Run

Your desktop icons will remain unchanged at first launch.

- **One-Click Organize**: Right-click the tray icon -> Select "Auto Organize". The app will automatically create fences and classify your files.
- **Show/Hide**: Double-click any empty space on the desktop, or left-click the tray icon.

## 2. Core Concepts: Fences

Fences are the building blocks of PureDesktop.

- **Automatic Fences**: Created by "Auto Organize", grouped by file types.
- **Mapped Fences**: Manually added to sync and display contents from a specific folder.
  - *How to add*: Right-click tray icon -> "Add Mapped Fence" -> Select a folder.

### Classification Logic

- **Shortcuts**: .lnk, .url
- **Documents**: .doc, .docx, .txt, .pdf, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.
- **Pictures**: .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .ico, etc.
- **Programs**: .exe, .msi
- **Archives**: .zip, .rar, .7z

## 3. Advanced Settings

### Exclusion Rules

Prevent specific items from being moved:

1. Go to "Settings" -> "Exclusions".
2. **Extensions**: Enter suffixes like `.tmp, .log`.
3. **Names/Folders**: Enter specific names like `Report.docx` or a folder name.

### Visual Customization

- **Opacity**: Right-click a fence title to adjust its individual transparency, or use tray settings for global opacity.
- **Acrylic Blur**: Premium Windows 11 style background is enabled by default.
- **Collapse Mode**: Click the fence title to collapse it into a slim header.

## 4. FAQ

**Q: Icons disappeared after "Auto Organize"?**
A: Ensure fences aren't hidden (double-click desktop), and check if they are overlapping or off-screen.

**Q: Does it start with Windows?**
A: Yes, you can toggle "Auto Start" in the tray menu.

**Q: How to remove a fence?**
A: Right-click the fence header -> "Remove Fence". Removing a standard fence won't delete the files inside.
